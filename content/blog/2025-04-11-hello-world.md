# Hello World

Hey there! I'm Jacob,

This blog is a place to talk about my progress, wins, and failures. But it will also be a place for me to vent my thoughts. I'll discuss everything from design to ai to building products.

I wanted a space where I could formulate my thoughts and show my progress. It's about accountability, creating a record of my work that motivates me to continue building rather than abandoning projects. When you share your journey publicly, it becomes harder to just quit.

## Current Projects

My main focus right now is [TMBuddy](https://tmbuddy.org), a SaaS project for merch designers and sellers. It helps them check their text designs for potential trademark infringement on existing trademarks. This is a significant issue in the merch selling community, as it's easy to receive strikes without understanding why. Just two or three strikes can result in losing a substantial portion, if not all, of your income.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge is finding time to build. With a regular 8-17 job and more ideas than time, I constantly need to ensure I keep scopes small and focus on projects most likely to bring value. And not just value to customers, but to my curiosity as well. It's about striking that balance between practicality and personal growth.

In upcoming projects, I hope to explore AI pipelines more deeply, experimenting with mcp servers and other technologies that I find intriguing.

## Digital Nomad Life

I'm writing this blog post from Vietnam, trying out the digital nomad lifestyle. The weather is great, the living standard is extremely comfortable, and I've become more physically active by taking up both running and surfing.

The period is nearing its end, and it will be nice to get home to some good old meatballs and lingonberries again, but I would highly recommend trying this lifestyle if you have the chance!

All the best,
Jacob
