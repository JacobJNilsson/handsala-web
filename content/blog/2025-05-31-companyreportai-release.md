# Building in Public: A Company Analysis Landing Page

Hey there!

I just shipped a new landing page for a company analysis tool idea, and I wanted to share the journey behind it. You can check it out at [companyreport.ai](https://companyreport.ai).

## The Problem I'm Trying to Solve

Anyone who's worked on business projects knows how time-consuming competitor analysis can be. You're jumping between multiple websites, digging through financial reports, trying to piece together a coherent picture of what a company actually does, who they serve, and how they're performing. It's tedious work that often takes hours just to get basic insights.

Separately, I've been watching way too many Warren Buffett interviews lately (seriously, it's becoming a problem), and it got me thinking about making better, more informed decisions when buying stocks. Instead of relying on gut feel and the most basic analytics, I wanted access to comprehensive company insights that could actually inform investment decisions.

## What I Built

Right now, it's just a landing page. I'm not trying to oversell this as some revolutionary product. The goal is simple: test if others find this problem as frustrating as I do, and more importantly, understand what features they'd actually want in a tool like this.

The page focuses on comprehensive company analysis without getting too caught up in the "AI-powered" buzzwords. People buying business intelligence care about accuracy and insights, not the technology behind it. I learned this lesson from working on TMBuddy, where the value proposition matters more than the technical implementation.

## Collecting Real Feedback

The most interesting part of this experiment is the feedback form on the waitlist signup. Instead of just collecting emails, I'm asking: "What insight or feature do we need to get perfect? Let us know!"

I'm committed to building this service regardless, but I want to collect feedback early to build something useful right from the start. Understanding whether people prioritize deeper financial analysis, better competitive intelligence, market positioning insights, or something entirely different will help me make better decisions about where to focus first.

## The Technical Side

I built this with Next.js, Tailwind, and Supabase with a clean, professional design approach. The goal was a look that doesn't scream "startup trying too hard." Sometimes the best design is the one that gets out of the way and lets users focus on the value proposition.

## What's Next

I'm moving forward with building the data collection and reporting system. This solves a real problem I face regularly, and I need the practical experience building AI workflows and data pipelines. The early feedback will help me prioritize features and build something genuinely useful from day one.

## Lessons from TMBuddy

Working on TMBuddy has taught me valuable lessons about timing and market conditions. TMBuddy addresses a real problem in the merch seller community, but the timing has been challenging. Amazon's recent policy changes to their Merch on Demand program have made the environment difficult for sellers, but we'll be ready when the community has more time to focus on these issues again.

These experiences shaped my approach to this new project. Understanding that even solving real problems requires the right market conditions and timing.

You can check out the landing page and let me know what you think. Even if company analysis isn't your thing, I'd love feedback on the approach or the execution.

All the best,
Jacob
